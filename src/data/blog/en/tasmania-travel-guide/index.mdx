## **Tasmania travel guide**

Tasmania is like a Tardis. On the map it just looks like a small island, and indeed it is. Just 364km north to south and 306km east to west. Yet Tassie will transport you to another world. There are numerous ‘doors’ to open, with 19 national parks each offering different views and experiences. As well as many other wild places, coastal, mountainous or rainforest, to wander through and lust over.

**I got Tasmania all wrong. I thought it was where retired Aussies went to pootle around in their hire cars on holiday.**&#x20;

**But Tassie is full on adventure, wilderness and never ending beauty.**

Spend a week hiking through its heart on the Cradle Mountain Overland Track. Or bushwalking in the northernmost Narawntapu National Park, where wombats and wallabies abound. You can spend weeks here and see a new view every day – such as exploring an island off the island, of which you can take your pick. There are 334 of them. With a history of convict settlements and colonial conflict, Tasmania has travelled through time to a place of peace. And a place where one feels total freedom.
