People ask how we survived without helmets and knee pads.

They shake their heads like we were reckless.

Like we were careless.

But the truth is… we weren’t careless.

We were learning.

We learned balance the hard way.

We learned courage on two wheels.

We learned that falling hurts… but getting back up matters more.

Those scraped knees were not accidents.

They were badges.

Proof that we tried.

Proof that we weren’t afraid.

You could hear the metal pedals scrape the pavement.

You could feel the sting of gravel in your skin.

You’d wipe the tears away before anyone saw.

Because crying wasn’t the end.

Getting back on the bike was.

Nobody rushed out with bubble wrap.

Nobody hovered over us.

They looked out the window and said,

“You’re fine. Walk it off.”

And somehow… we were.

We didn’t grow up fearless.

We grew up resilient.

And maybe that’s the difference.
