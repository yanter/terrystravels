If you remember the sound of chalk scraping across the board, you know exactly what I mean.&#x20;

Teachers wrote every lesson by hand, and we copied it carefully into our notebooks.&#x20;

There were no smart boards, no tablets, no instant answers.&#x20;

Just discipline, repetition, and effort.&#x20;

You raised your hand and waited to be called on.&#x20;

You respected the classroom because learning was a privilege.&#x20;

Somehow, those simple rooms built strong foundations.&#x20;

And many of us still carry those lessons with pride today.
